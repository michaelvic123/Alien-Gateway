//! # Core Identity Contract
//!
//! This contract implements a privacy-preserving identity and resolution system
//! built around a **commitment-based ownership model**. It enables users to
//! register usernames, associate them with blockchain addresses (including
//! Stellar), and transfer ownership securely.
//!
//! ## Identity Model Overview
//!
//! The system is built on the following flow:
//!
//! ```text
//! Commitment (hash) → Username → SMT Root → Resolved Addresses
//! ```
//!
//! ### 1. Commitment (`h: BytesN<32>`)
//! - A cryptographic hash representing a username (or identity).
//! - Acts as the **primary identifier** in the system.
//! - Designed to preserve privacy by avoiding plaintext usernames on-chain.
//!
//! ### 2. Username Ownership
//! - A commitment is **owned by an `Address`**.
//! - Ownership is established during registration.
//! - Ownership is required for all mutations (e.g., adding addresses, transfer).
//!
//! ### 3. Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT Root)
//! - The global state of all commitments is represented by an SMT root.
//! - The root is stored on-chain and updated by the contract admin.
//! - ZK proofs rely on this root to validate membership and correctness.
//!
//! ### 4. Address Resolution
//! - A commitment can resolve to:
//!   - A primary wallet address
//!   - Optional memo
//!   - Multiple chain-specific addresses
//!   - Multiple Stellar addresses
//!   - Optional shielded (privacy-preserving) address
//!
//! ## Privacy & Zero-Knowledge Proofs
//!
//! Certain operations (e.g., resolver registration, ownership transfer) support
//! **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** to:
//!
//! - Prove ownership or validity without revealing sensitive data
//! - Enable privacy-preserving interactions
//!
//! The contract verifies proofs against the current SMT root.
//!
//! ## Ownership & Transfer Semantics
//!
//! Ownership of a commitment can be transferred in two ways:
//!
//! ### 1. Direct Transfer
//! - Requires the current owner (`Address`) to authorize the transfer.
//! - Updates the owner mapping immediately.
//!
//! ### 2. ZK-based Transfer
//! - Uses a zero-knowledge proof to authorize the transfer.
//! - Enables privacy-preserving ownership changes.
//!
//! ### Guarantees
//! - Only the **current valid owner** (or valid proof) can transfer ownership.
//! - All ownership changes are **atomic and consistent**.
//!
//! ## Storage Model
//!
//! The contract maintains:
//! - Commitment → Owner mappings
//! - Commitment → Address mappings (multi-chain + Stellar)
//! - Commitment → Metadata (memo, privacy mode)
//! - SMT root (global state anchor)
//!
//! Soft constraints:
//! - No plaintext usernames stored
//! - All lookups are keyed by commitment
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! This contract enables:
//! - Decentralized username ownership
//! - Cross-chain identity resolution
//! - Privacy-preserving identity operations
//! - Secure and auditable ownership transfers
//!
//! It is designed for interoperability with wallets, identity systems,
//! and off-chain indexers that rely on deterministic resolution.
